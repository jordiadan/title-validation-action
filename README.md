# GitHub Action for Validating Pull Request Titles

This GitHub Action checks if the title of a pull request meets specific criteria. The criteria include:

* The title must start with one of the following prefixes: `FEATURE`, `FIX`, `TECH`, or `DOCS`
* The title must contain one of the following emojis after the prefix: üö¢, üîç, or ‚ùì
* The title must contain a reference to a JIRA ticket after the emoji, in the format `SCMI-12345`.

## Output
If the pull request title is valid, the Action will log The pull request title is valid.

If the pull request title is invalid, the Action will set the status of the Action to failed and log an error message indicating which criteria was not met.

## Example

```
